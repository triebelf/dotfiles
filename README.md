# Collection of my dotfiles
- support Ubuntu, Fedora, and Windows (Cygwin)
- minimalism, keep the configuration files small

## tmux
* dependencies: urlview, xclip, wlclipboard

## vim
* some of the plugins have external dependencies
* plugin YouCompleteMe on Windows+Cygwin doesn't work, because vim cannot find
  Python3 installation, so switch to the "legacy-py2" branch
