# Felix' Configuration Files

My personal collection of configuration files, `dotfiles`, for a text-based integrated development environment.
Configuration files are grouped into sub-directories for example `bash`. You can manually create a symbolic link from
your home directory, for example `.bash_profile -> .dotfiles/bash/.bash_profile`, or you may automate that process by
using the Gnu `stow` tool.
